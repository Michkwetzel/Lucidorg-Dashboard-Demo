## 💡 What I Learned

### Technical
End-to-end product architecture, Flutter/Dart proficiency, serverless backend integration, JWT implementation

### Product
User research is non-negotiable, so is product validation. Beautiful dashboards mean nothing without clear value delivery. There are far quicker ways to build an MVP. Client-facing products require 10x more polish than internal tools.

### The Pivot
Post-launch revealed businesses need flexible organizational structures, not fixed hierarchies. The analytics we were showing weren't actionable for clients. This required scrapping our approach and rebuilding the product from scratch.
